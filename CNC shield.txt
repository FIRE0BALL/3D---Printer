CNC shield V3.0(COMPUTER NUMERICAL CONTROL)
 -GRBL Firmware support(Open Source)(Translate GCODE to steps and direction signals.)
 -works with UNO
 -support A4988 & DRV8825 drive modules

A4988 Drive Module
 -widely used to control BIPOLAR stepper motor
 -PINS
  -Control pin:
   1.Step = input to control steps
   2.Direction = input to control direction
   3.Enable = Activate or Deactivate
  -Microstepping Pins:
    MS1,MS2,MS3 = logic HIGH or LOW
  -Outputs:
    2A/2B and 1A/1B connect with 2 coil of motor




We need to adjust potentiometer on Drive module according our current requirement. 
Using V=IR formula.
V(ref) = I(motor) * 
(A4988 gets hot in 2A its require cooling fan, heat sink) 









---------------HOW TO USE, CHECK STEPPER MOTOR------------


# Connect UNO with CNC shield 
# Connect A4988 drive module on CNC
# Run grbl library from example code.(grbl library is not preinstalled, install it from web) 
# Install <universal Gcode sender> application 
# extract and run UGSPLATFORM from bin folder
# firmware-GRBL,    baud rate-115200,    port -should be same as UNO's port in Arduino IDE
# click on connect icon (left of firmware)
# check console
# control Motors from JOG CONTROLLER.
